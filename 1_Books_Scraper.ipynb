    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**First method: **\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it if you want to collect the data by yourself, and you can decide which categories of books you want to collect. The general steps of this method are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a list (category) of books (like language, arts, biography...etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open all pages in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Getting all books URLs within the list\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scrape each book data and save it into a dataframe and csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second method:** \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it if you have a list of books URLs and you want to scrape the books directly. The examples of the ***input*** of this method are in [Data/Lists_of_Links](https://github.com/iHaifaa/Arabic_Books_Recommendation_System/tree/main/Data/Lists_of_Links) folder. \n",

    "| Average_Ratings | Average rate for a given book. |\n",

    "| Pages_Number | Amount of pages per title. |\n",
    "| Editions | Number of different editions for the book, not the current one. |\n",
    "| Publication_Year | Year of the first publication. |\n",
